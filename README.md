# rpn-calculator

RPN Calculator is a calculator based on Postfix-notation. In Reverse Polish Notation the operator follows the operands as opposed to the normal notation. The calculator reads expression to operate on from files. The calculator is implemented using stack and hash table from singly linked list with a dummy node.

Done for second project of CS531 Fall 2019.
